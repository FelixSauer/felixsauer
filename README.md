# 👋 Hey there, I'm Felix Sauer

### 🧑‍💻 About Me
- I'm a Senior Dev from Stuttgart, with a love for automation, architecture, clean code and the kind of systems that don't break on Fridays. 
- For the past 10+ years, I've been building things that portals and ecommerce with a focus on frontend development.
- Most of my work has revolved around automotive, retail, and connected industries, helping brands go digital with confidence.
- I collaborate in German and English, write in TypeScript, speak YAML fluently, and dream in Git branches.
- Based in Stuttgart, right in the heart of Germany's automotive and tech scene.
- Powered by coffee and curiosity.
